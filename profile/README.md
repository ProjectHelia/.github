    Project HELIA
</h1>


HELIA (High-altitude Exposure Laboratory for Incubation and Analysis) is designed to provide a compact, adaptable, and reproducible platform that maintains a life-sustaining environment for biological samples in stratospheric conditions 20-30km. It actively monitors the biological payload’s response to cumulative ultraviolet (UV) radiation while preserving samples for detailed post-flight molecular analysis. It is meant to be adaptable for any future biological experiment that needs these conditions.
